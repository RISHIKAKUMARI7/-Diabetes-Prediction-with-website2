           <u>ABOUT DIABETES</u>
        </h1>
    <p>Diabetes is a chronic (long-lasting) health condition that affects how your body turns food into energy.<br>

Your body breaks down most of the food you eat into sugar (glucose) and releases it into your bloodstream.<br> When your blood sugar goes up, it signals your pancreas to release insulin.<br> Insulin acts like a key to let the blood sugar into your body’s cells for use as energy.<br>

With diabetes, your body doesn’t make enough insulin or can’t use it as well as it should.<br> When there isn’t enough insulin or cells stop responding to insulin, too much blood sugar stays in your bloodstream.<br> Over time, that can cause serious health problems, such as heart disease, vision loss, and kidney disease.</p>
    <p><u>Type 1 Diabetes </u>-
Type 1 diabetes is thought to be caused by an autoimmune reaction (the body attacks itself by mistake). This reaction stops your body from making insulin. Approximately 5-10% of the people who have diabetes have type 1. Symptoms of type 1 diabetes often develop quickly. It’s usually diagnosed in children, teens, and young adults. If you have type 1 diabetes, you’ll need to take insulin every day to survive. Currently, no one knows how to prevent type 1 diabetes.</p>
<p><u>Type 2 Diabetes</u> -
With type 2 diabetes, your body doesn’t use insulin well and can’t keep blood sugar at normal levels. About 90-95% of people with diabetes have type 2. It develops over many years and is usually diagnosed in adults (but more and more in children, teens, and young adults). You may not notice any symptoms, so it’s important to get your blood sugar tested if you’re at risk. Type 2 diabetes can be prevented or delayed with healthy lifestyle changes, such as:

Losing weight.
Eating healthy food.
Being active.</p><p><u>Gestational Diabetes </u>-
Gestational diabetes develops in pregnant women who have never had diabetes. If you have gestational diabetes, your baby could be at higher risk for health problems. Gestational diabetes usually goes away after your baby is born. However, it increases your risk for type 2 diabetes later in life. Your baby is more likely to have obesity as a child or teen and develop type 2 diabetes later in life.</p>
